# Testing

Comprehensive testing documentation for BulletBuzz, covering unit tests, headless simulation, and automated screenshot testing.

## Testing Overview

BulletBuzz includes a comprehensive testing suite designed to ensure game quality, balance, and performance:

- **Unit Tests**: 28 comprehensive tests covering all game systems
- **Headless Simulation**: Automated balance testing with thousands of game runs
- **Screenshot Testing**: Automated visual testing with Playwright
- **Performance Testing**: Memory usage and performance monitoring
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end game flow testing

## Testing Categories

### Unit Testing
Core game logic testing with Jest framework.

### Headless Simulation
Automated balance testing and performance analysis.

### Screenshot Testing
Visual regression testing with Playwright.

### Performance Testing
Memory usage and performance monitoring.

### Integration Testing
End-to-end game flow and UI testing.

## Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash

4. **Performance Testing** - Memory and performance monitoring
5. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end testing

## Testing Goals

### Quality Assurance
- **Functionality**: All game systems work correctly
- **Balance**: Game difficulty is appropriate and engaging
- **Performance**: Game runs smoothly without memory leaks
- **Visual**: UI elements display correctly across browsers

### Development Support
- **Regression Prevention**: Changes don't break existing functionality
- **Refactoring Safety**: Code changes are validated automatically
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Debugging**: Tests help identify and isolate issues

### Continuous Integration
- **Automated Testing**: All tests run automatically on changes
- **Coverage Reporting**: Track test coverage and identify gaps
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance regressions
- **Visual Regression**: Detect UI changes automatically

## Testing Tools

### Jest
- **Unit Testing**: Core game logic testing
- **Mocking**: Isolate components for testing
- **Coverage**: Track test coverage
- **Watch Mode**: Development-friendly testing

### Playwright
- **Screenshot Testing**: Visual regression testing
- **Cross-Browser**: Test across multiple browsers
- **Automation**: Automated UI testing
- **Visual Feedback**: Screenshot comparison

### Node.js
- **Headless Simulation**: Server-side game testing
- **Performance Testing**: Memory and CPU monitoring
- **Balance Testing**: Automated game balance analysis
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow testing

## Test Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ line coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All major game flows
- **Screenshot Tests**: All UI states and interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Memory usage under 100MB, 60 FPS

### Quality Gates
- **All Tests Pass**: No failing tests in CI
- **Coverage Maintained**: Coverage doesn't decrease
- **Performance Stable**: No performance regressions
- **Visual Consistency**: No unexpected UI changes

## Testing Infrastructure

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on every commit
- **Coverage Reports**: Automated coverage reporting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automated performance tracking
- **Screenshot Comparison**: Automated visual regression detection

### Development Tools
- **Watch Mode**: Real-time test feedback during development
- **Debug Mode**: Detailed test output for debugging
- **Mock Data**: Consistent test data for reliable tests
- **Test Utilities**: Helper functions for common testing patterns

## Testing Best Practices

### Writing Tests
- **Descriptive Names**: Clear test names that explain the behavior
- **Isolated Tests**: Each test is independent and can run alone
- **Fast Execution**: Tests complete quickly for rapid feedback
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all code paths and edge cases

### Maintaining Tests
- **Keep Tests Updated**: Update tests when code changes
- **Refactor Tests**: Improve test code as the codebase evolves
- **Monitor Coverage**: Track and improve test coverage
- **Review Test Results**: Regularly review and act on test failures

### Test Organization
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related tests together
- **Clear Structure**: Organize tests in a logical hierarchy
- **Consistent Patterns**: Use consistent testing patterns
- **Documentation**: Document complex test scenarios
